KEY:
*: done enough
=: can ignore for now
+: section good for now



Things to Do:
1) Add battle movement
    1) Ship not allowed to move if at 'disadvatage' (that needs defining)
    2) If not at 'disadvatage' (tied or advantage) can move 1 in any direction
    3) follow mechanic
2) BattleCounters
    -destroying ships
3) Spawning ships
4) How will I handle multiple ships on the same tile?
    ?? Can limit to 9 ships per tile for now... this will have to due atm
    -later- Black the tile, have a new tab on the side that has all
      the ships in it... that will be better than limiting, but this
    is going to be an issue with the choosen tools
5) Scoring
