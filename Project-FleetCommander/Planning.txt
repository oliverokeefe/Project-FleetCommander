KEY:
*: done enough
=: can ignore for now
+: section good for now

Battle Mechanics:
    Movement:
        1) Ships can move 1 in any direction when on a tile with at least one enemy ships
        2) Ships can NOT move if outnumbered by 3 or more
    Supply:
        1) Ships lose 1 supply at the end of each round if on tile with at least one enemey ship
        2) Ships lose 0 supply if outnumbering the opponent by 2 or more
        3) Ships gain 1 supply at end of each round on tile with 0 enemy ships


Things to Do:
1) Supply
    1) Ships are destroyed if they have 0 supply at the END of round
    2) Ships gain 1 supply at END of the round if on tile with 0 enemy ships
    3) Ships lose 1 supply at the END of the round if on tile with at least one enemey ship
    4) Ships lose 0 supply if outnumbering the opponent by 2 or more
        -Should destroy or supply calculate first?
            -Destroy, that way supply accuratley reflects amount of rounds of combat a ship will survive
2) Spawning ships
    1) Need a player ship hud...
        Div with list of:
            -ShipClass ID [SPAWN BTN]
            -btn disabled when ship is spawned, enabled when destroyed
            -hover on btn will "highlight" the spawn location (Or could suggest() )
3) How will I handle multiple ships on the same tile?
    ?? Can limit to 9 ships per tile for now... this will have to due atm
    -later- Black the tile, have a new tab on the side that has all
      the ships in it... that will be better than limiting, but this
    is going to be an issue with the choosen tools
